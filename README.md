# Purpse: Simple front-end app for AWS deployment course students.

<h1><b>Overview</b><br></h1>
Anything but elegant, it's nothing but Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS and a bit of frustration as I forgot how hard it is to live without state management the past several years. Requires as little web dev understanding as possible.

It is the bones of the materialize css starter theme.

<h1><b>Technologies Used</b></h1>
Front-end only
jQuery
materializecss
localStorage
Notes
The code is heavily commented and follows a very basic procedural structure. jQuery listeners stand in place of native JS listeners as more people are familiar with jQuery selection syntax.
